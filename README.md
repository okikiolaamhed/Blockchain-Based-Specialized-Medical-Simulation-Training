# Blockchain-Based Specialized Medical Simulation Training

This decentralized platform leverages blockchain technology to improve medical simulation training by creating verifiable records of equipment, instructor qualifications, training scenarios, and performance assessments. The system enables transparent tracking of medical training processes while ensuring data integrity and trainee privacy.

## System Overview

The Blockchain-Based Specialized Medical Simulation Training platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Simulator Registration Contract**: Documents medical training equipment and environments
2. **Instructor Certification Contract**: Validates qualifications of simulation educators
3. **Scenario Management Contract**: Organizes and tracks specific clinical simulations
4. **Performance Assessment Contract**: Measures and analyzes trainee skill development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Blockchain development environment (Truffle/Hardhat)
- Web3 library
- Medical simulation hardware integration capability
- Digital wallet (MetaMask or similar)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-simulation-blockchain.git
   cd medical-simulation-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to test network
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
   ```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Simulator Registration Contract
Documents comprehensive details about medical simulation equipment including mannequins, virtual reality systems, procedural trainers, and immersive environments. Each simulator receives a unique identifier with specifications, capabilities, maintenance history, and calibration status.

### Instructor Certification Contract
Validates and securely stores instructor credentials including medical specialties, teaching certifications, simulation methodology training, and experience records. Ensures only qualified educators can conduct and evaluate specific types of medical simulations.

### Scenario Management Contract
Manages the creation, modification, and implementation of clinical training scenarios. Tracks scenario details including medical conditions simulated, difficulty levels, learning objectives, and required equipment.

### Performance Assessment Contract
Records trainee performance metrics while maintaining privacy and security. Measures skill acquisition, procedural accuracy, clinical decision-making, and teamwork competencies with verifiable evaluation records.

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Simulator
```javascript
const simulatorRegistry = await SimulatorRegistrationContract.deployed();
await simulatorRegistry.registerSimulator(
  "Advanced Patient Simulator XR-9000",
  "High-fidelity adult mannequin with comprehensive physiological responses",
  "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/specs.json",
  ["cardiac", "respiratory", "trauma"],
  "OPERATIONAL",
  "2025-02-15" // last calibration date
);
```

### Creating a Training Scenario
```javascript
const scenarioManager = await ScenarioManagementContract.deployed();
await scenarioManager.createScenario(
  "Acute Myocardial Infarction Management",
  "Emergency response to patient with ST-elevation MI complications",
  ["cardiac", "emergency", "team-based"],
  "ADVANCED",
  ["SIM-XR-9000", "DEFIBRILLATOR-SIM-450"],
  "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRzTuh5EYuMqQNwTwBnmC2qAN7TwH5T9NpifziwKLgMtT/scenario.json"
);
```

## Features

- **Equipment Verification**: Maintains accurate records of simulator capabilities and status
- **Instructor Validation**: Ensures proper qualifications for medical education
- **Scenario Standardization**: Creates consistent training experiences across institutions
- **Objective Assessment**: Provides immutable records of competency development
- **Credential Portability**: Enables secure transfer of training records between organizations
- **Quality Improvement**: Facilitates data-driven enhancement of simulation programs
